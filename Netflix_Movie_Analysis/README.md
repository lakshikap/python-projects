# Netflix and the Problem Context:
We perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Netflix movie dataset to answer two business problems for the business, on content and growth.
1) Business Problem 1: Netflix, the streaming company wants to understand its existing content catalog. What are the dominant content types (Movie vs TV Show), and how are they distributed by year and genre?
2) Business Problem 2: Netflix wants to understand content diversity and which countries dominate which genres. Where are there gaps to expand?

In order to arrive at the solution, we explore the data to identify any issues in the data which may hinder the analysis. 
Then we clean the data using 

## Prerequisites:
1) Install packages, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
2) For the world map, we install pycountry and plotly.express.
3) We recommend Jupyter Notebook if you wish to run the code, it can be downloaded directly.
4) The data is explored, cleaned and required columns are normalized prior to the analysis.

## Input:
We use the netflix_titles_Nov2019.csv file from Kaggle as the basis for the analysis.
We form our own business case as mentioned in the problem context above.
We use Python for the analysis.

## Output: 
We produce several charts for analysis and draw insights.
Charts include: 
1) Dominant Content Types
2) Content Added to Netflix by Year
3) Top 10 Genres
4) Trends by Year
5) Top Content Producing Countries
6) Genre vs Country Heatmap
7) Number of Titles Per Country in a World Map

### 8) Insights are mentioned in each section in the analysis.
