We perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Netflix movie dataset to answer two business problems for the business, on content and growth.
1) Business Problem 1: Netflix, the streaming company wants to understand its existing content catalog. What are the dominant content types (Movie vs TV Show), and how are they distributed by year and genre?
2) Business Problem 2: Netflix wants to understand content diversity and which countries dominate which genres. Where are there gaps to expand?
