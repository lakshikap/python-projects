# Python Data Science Projects
1. This repository contains several personal projects nad uOttawa course based projects.
2. Course based projects are from DTI5125 Data Science Applications.
3. Personal Projects are from several online certification courses as well as personally designed projects to showcase skills in data analysis.
4. I use **Jupyter Notebook,** **PyCharm,** **Google Collab** and **VSCode** as IDEs in these projects.
5. All projects have a readme file which guides you, except for the basic and advanced coding folders as they are beginner programs.

# In the journey to enhance programming skills
I have interesting projects in the pipeline, and I look forward to publishing them!
